    <h1 align="center"><u>LATERITE SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > The name has been derived from the Latin word “later” which means brick.
    It accounts for about 3.7% of the total area of the country.
    These are typical soils of the monsoon climate which is characterised by seasonal rainfall. With rain, lime and silica are leached away, and soil rich in iron oxide and aluminium are left leading to the formation of laterite soil.
    Laterite soil is deficient in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphate and calcium, however iron oxide and potash are in abundance.
    Although low in fertility, they respond well to manures and fertilisers.
    Laterite soils are found in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and hilly regions of Assam and Odisha.
    Red laterite soil in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are well suited for tree crop cultivation like cashew nuts.
    Laterite soil hardens rapidly and irreversibly on exposure to the air, a property that leads to its use as building bricks in southern India.</p><br><br>
    <p>Historically, laterite was cut into brick-like shapes and used in monument-building. After 1000 CE,
         construction at Angkor Wat and other southeast Asian sites changed to rectangular temple enclosures made of laterite, brick, and stone.
          Since the mid-1970s, some trial sections of bituminous-surfaced, low-volume roads have used laterite in place of stone as a base course. Thick laterite layers are porous and slightly permeable,
           so the layers can function as aquifers in rural areas. Locally available laterites have been used in an acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove phosphorus and heavy metals at sewage-treatment facilities.
    Laterites are a source of aluminum ore; the ore exists largely in clay minerals and the hydroxides, gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore, which resembles the composition of bauxite.
     In Northern Ireland they once provided a major source of iron and aluminum ores. Laterite ores also were the early major source of nickel.</p><br><bR>

<P align="center"><u><b> CROPS THAT GROW ON LATERITE SOIL</b></u></P><br><br>
<P >It is possible to grow plantation crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, cinchona, 
    coconut, arecanut, and so on by manured and irrigation. In some areas, the soils support 
    grazing grounds and scrub forests.<BR>
    Laterite soils can be found in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, 
    and the hilly areas of Odisha and Assam. Hillier areas are ideal for them because they are relatively
     warm and humid.
    Because of iron oxides, these soils are red. They are coarse in texture and lacking in nitrogen,
     phosphorus, potash, and urea. These soils are not very fertile and will only be useful when supplemented 
     with sufficient manure and fertilizer.

<P align="center"><u><b>IMPORTANCE OF  LATERITE SOIL</b></u></P><br><br>
<p>
    Laterite soil can be found on the plateau’s edge in Tamil Nadu, Odisha, a small part of Chotanagpur in the north,
     and Shillong in the north-east. This type of soil is unsuitable for agriculture, but crops such as coffee, rubber,
      cinchona, cashews, and coconut can be grown here. Tea, coffee, and cashew are the three main commercial 
      crops grown in laterite soil.
