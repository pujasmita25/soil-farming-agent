    <h1 align="center"><u>MOUNTAIN SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > This type of soil is found in the forest regions where rainfall is sufficient.
    The texture of the soil depends on the mountain environment where they are found.
    These soils are coarse-grained in the upper slopes and loamy and silty on valley sides.
    In the snowbound areas of the Himalayas, these soils undergo denudation and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the lower valleys are fertile.
    Also called forest soil.<BR><br>
        <u><b>Features of Mountain Soils</b></u><br>
        The basic character of the mountain soils depend on the climate and are mainly found in the warm temperate belt or the cool temperate belt of the Himalaya Mountains. Brown forest soil is mainly found in the warm temperate belt lying at heights ranging from 900 to 1800 metres, which has deciduous forests. This belt comprises enough warmth for decomposition of vegetation. The typical brown forest soil of this zone is rich in humus and is deep. Further, mountains soils are rich in humus, slightly acidic and are fertile. Mountains soils are also deprived in lime and potash content. They are largely used for raising different varieties of crops.
        
        Podzol is the characteristic soil of cool wet temperate zone with coniferous forests. Almost above an altitude of 1800 metres, brown forests soil grades into Podozolised soils. At this belt with Podzol soil, vegetation is comparatively low because of low temperature and thick forests. This mountain soil is a bit highly leached soil and acidic in reaction. It is poorly fertile too. Alpine meadow soil is a dark coloured thin soil mainly found in the Alpine zone of the Himalayan Mountain range. It is basically sandy and contains un-decomposed plants.

      various herbs, cabbages, cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale, and apples, pears, plums,
       cherries, peaches, apricots, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries grow 
       in profusion in both mountain ranges.
