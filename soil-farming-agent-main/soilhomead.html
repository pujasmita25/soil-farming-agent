    <br><b>WHAT IS SOIL?</b><BR><BR>
        <B>Soil</B>, the biologically active, porous medium that has developed in the uppermost layer of
         Earthâ€™s crust. Soil is one of the principal substrata of life on Earth, serving as a reservoir of 
         water and nutrients, as a medium for the filtration and breakdown of injurious wastes, and as a participant
          in the cycling of carbon and other elements through the global ecosystem. It has evolved through
           weathering processes driven by biological, climatic, geologic, and topographic influences.<BR><BR>
            <b>THE SOIL HORIZON</b><BR><BR>
            Soils differ widely in their properties because of geologic and climatic variation over distance and time.
             Even a simple property, such as the soil thickness, can range from a few centimetres to many metres, 
             depending on the intensity and duration of weathering, episodes of soil deposition and erosion, and the
              patterns of landscape evolution. Nevertheless, in spite of this variability, soils have a unique structural 
              characteristic that distinguishes them from mere earth materials and serves as a basis for their
               classification: a vertical sequence of layers produced by the combined actions of percolating waters
                and living organisms.<BR><BR>
