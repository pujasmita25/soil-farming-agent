    <h1 align="center"><u>RED AND YELLOW SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > Also known as the “omnibus group”.
    It covers about 18.5 % of the total land area of the country.
    It is found in regions of low rainfall (eastern and southern parts of the Deccan Plateau). Along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats, a long stretch of area is occupied by red loamy soil. This soil is also present in parts of Odisha and Chattisgarh and in the southern parts of the Middle Ganga Plain.
    The red colour is due to the presence of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. The soil appears yellow when it is in hydrated form.
    The fine-grained red and yellow soil is usually fertile while the coarse-grained soil is less fertile.
    This type of soil is generally deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and humus.<br><br>

    <u><b>Characteristics:</b></u><br><br>
    Red soils include multiple soil types (e.g. ultisols, alfisols, oxisols) that 
    are classified as red soil when they develop a distinct reddish color, which can vary from reddish brown 
    to reddish yellow due to their high iron content.In general, red soils possess some characteristics of
     a good growing soil . They are generally acidic soils, which can be positive for agriculture, but in this case
      often causes 
    a lack of sufficient nutrients. These soils are also prone to frequent drought in drier regions.<br><br>
    <u><b>Composition:</b></u><br><br>
Red soils are generally derived from the weathering of crystalline and metamorphic
 rock in areas of high rainfall. Red soil contains large amounts of clay and thin organic and
 organic-mineral layers of highly leached soil resting on an alluvium red layer.The composition and agricultural
  properties of red soil varies across regions. One type of red soil may be considered infertile in one region
   but nutrient-rich in another.
There is not a singular composition that classifies all red soils.
