    <h1 align="center"><u>ALLUVIAL SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > Alluvial soils are widespread in the northern plains and river valleys.
It covers about 40% of the total land area of the country. 
These soils are mainly derived from the debris brought down from the Himalayas.
In the Peninsular region, they are found in deltas of the east coast and in the river valleys.
The colour of the alluvial soil varies from light grey to ash grey.
The alluvial soil varies in nature from sandy loam to clay.
They are rich in potash but poor in phosphorus.<br><br>
Two different types of alluvial soils have developed in the Upper and Middle Ganga plains – Khadar and Bhangar.<br>
<U><b>Khadar</b></U>is the new alluvium and occupies the flood plains of the rivers. Khadar is enriched with fresh silt deposits every year.<br>
<U><b>Bhangar</b></U> is the old alluvium, deposited away from the flood plains.
Both Khadar and Bhangar soils contain concretion (kankars) of impure calcium carbonate.
These soils are more loamy and clayey in the lower and middle Ganga plains and the Brahmaputra valley.
Alluvial soils are intensely cultivated – wheat, maize, sugarcane, pulses, oilseed, etc. are mainly cultivated.</p><br><br>
