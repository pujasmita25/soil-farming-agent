    <h1 align="center"><u>DESSERT SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > Also known as arid soil, it accounts for over 4.42 % of the total land area of the country. 
    The colour ranges from red to brown.
    Desert soils are sandy to gravelly in texture, have low moisture content and low water-retaining capacity.
    These soils are saline in nature and in certain regions the salt content is so high that common salt is obtained by evaporating water.
    These soils have normal phosphate content but are deficient in nitrogen.
    Due to increased calcium content in the lower horizons of the soil, there is the formation of ‘kankar’ layers. These kankar layers restrict the penetration of water and as such when water is made available through irrigation, the soil moisture is readily available for sustainable plant growth.
    Desert soils are profoundly found in western Rajasthan and contain little humus and organic matter.</p><br><br>

    <u><b>Special Issues in the Desert:</b></u><br><br>
    The deserts are very fertile, which means that, if provided with water, they can grow a lot of food. This can by done by providing water with irrigation technology. The Central Valley in California produces 250 types of fruits and vegetables, and does so with river water, aquifers, and streams.

Sometimes irrigation water can be used up, so it is important to consider conservation options. 
Irrigating in a dry climate, especially flood irrigation can cause the water to evaporate very quickly. 
When that happens, the salts are left behind on the soil surface. This build up of salt is called salinization.
 Since few crops can deal with high salt levels, the soils become too salty to grow anything.<br><br>
