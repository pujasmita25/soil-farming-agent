    <h1 align="center"><u>BLACK SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > Black soil is also known as “Regur Soil” or the “Black Cotton Soil”.
    It covers about 15% of the total land area of the country.
    It covers most of the Deccan Plateau – parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Tamil Nadu. In the upper reaches of the Godavari and Krishna, and the north-western part of Deccan Plateau, the black soil is very deep.
    The colour of these soils varies from deep black to grey.
    The black soils are generally clayey, deep and impermeable. They swell greatly and become sticky when wet in the rainy season. In the dry season, the moisture evaporates, the soil shrinks and develops wide cracks.
    Black soils are rich in iron, lime, aluminium, magnesium and also contain potassium. However, these soils are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter.
    Cotton, pulses, millets, castor, tobacco, sugarcane, citrus fruits, linseed, etc. are mainly cultivated in black soil.</p><br><br>
