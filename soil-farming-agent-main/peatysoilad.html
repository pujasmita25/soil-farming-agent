    <h1 align="center"><u>PEATY AND MARSHY SOIL</u></h1><br>
   <p > These soils are found in regions of heavy rainfall and high humidity, and it supports the good growth of vegetation.
    Peaty soils are rich in humus and organic matter.
    These soils are generally heavy and black in colour. In many places, these soils are alkaline.
    These are found in southern Uttarakhand, the northern part of Bihar, and the coastal areas of West Bengal, 
    Odisha and Tamil Nadu.<BR>
        Peaty soil is formed naturally by incomplete decomposition of organisms such as plants and animals in wetland areas under low atmospheric temperature and anaerobic conditions. 
Peaty Soil formed in the region having heavy rainfall with high humidity that supported good growth of vegetation. As a result, a high quantity of dead organisms matters accumulated leads to rich humus and organic content to soils; that is peaty soil.
Peaty soil is a storehouse of carbon; Globally,  it is estimated that peaty soil has more carbon as compared 
to carbon accumulated in crude reserve.<BR>

    <br><p align="center"><u><b></b>The following are the characteristics:</b></u></p><br><br>
    .It is alkaline in nature and has pH values of more than 7.5.<br>
    .Peaty soil is not suitable for vegetation or crops as it is alkaline soil and alkaline soil prevents the roots of plants to use nutrients effectively.<br>
    .For making Peaty soil fertile or lowering the pH values of soil sulfur, ferrous sulfate, and aluminum sulfate can be used.<br>
    .It is soft and easily compressed.<br>
    .It is heavy and black in color.<br>
    .It can be used as fuel when dry.<br>
    .It is the storehouse of Carbon and it uses a tool for carbon sequestration.<br>
    .It has rich humus and organic content<br>
